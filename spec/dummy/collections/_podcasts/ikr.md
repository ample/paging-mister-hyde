<p>Being a woman… it’s complicated. Right? The expectations. The relationships. All the freaking beauty products. It can be overwhelming to try to go it alone. IKR? - I know, right? - is a podcast for women, by women. It’s a place to be known. To be challenged. To be understood. Because no one wants to go it alone. Hosts Alli and Latasha pull back the veil on what’s going on in the minds of women to prove that we’re all in this together and there’s a God who wants in on it too.</p>
